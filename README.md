# AWS-ALB-vs-Azure-App-Gateway
Who Really Trusts Your Configuration?

When building scalable web applications in the cloud, **load balancers** play a silent but critical role. But not all load balancers behave the same — especially when it comes to **health checks**.

Here’s an interesting real-world observation:

> ⚠️ **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)** will continue routing traffic to a target group **even if all targets are unhealthy**, as long as the listener rule forwards to it.

> ✅ **Azure Application Gateway**, on the other hand, **immediately stops** sending traffic to backends that fail health probes.

## 🔍 What's Really Happening?

### ✅ AWS ALB: “I Trust Your Configuration.”

- Listener rules are **absolute** — if you say "forward to this target group," it will.
- It does **not block routing** even if all health checks fail.
- This means:
  - A **misconfigured health check** can silently break your app.
  - ALB won’t stop routing — it assumes you're in control.
- Even without sticky sessions, ALB may send traffic to unhealthy targets due to:
  - Grace periods
  - Connection reuse (keep-alive)
  - Health status propagation lag

---

### ✅ Azure App Gateway: “I Trust Industry Baselines.”

- App Gateway enforces **strict health check logic**.
- If all targets fail health probes, it returns **502 Bad Gateway** to the client.
- You get **immediate visibility** into problems.
- It is designed to “fail loudly” — prioritizing safety and reliability over flexibility.

## ⚔️ Design Philosophy Comparison

| Feature                         | AWS ALB                          | Azure App Gateway                  |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Health check enforcement        | Lenient, config-driven           | Strict, policy-driven              |
| Listener behavior               | Forwards traffic regardless of health | Blocks traffic if unhealthy     |
| Misconfigured health checks     | Traffic still flows (and fails)  | Immediately blocks with 502        |
| Flexibility vs Safety           | High flexibility, low guardrails | Safer defaults, less flexibility   |

## 🧠 TL;DR: Who Do They Trust?

- **AWS trusts _you_ (your config)** – great power, greater responsibility.
- **Azure trusts _best practices_** – more guardrails, less manual failure.

## 💡 Takeaway for Architects & DevOps Engineers

If you're using **AWS ALB**, validate your:
- Health check paths
- Ports
- Return codes
- Listener rules

Don’t assume traffic will stop just because the backend fails.

If you're on **Azure App Gateway**, understand that it may block traffic _by design_ if probes fail — and that’s usually a good thing.

## 📌 Final Thought

Your infrastructure is only as resilient as your **failover behavior**. Whether you choose AWS or Azure, know how your load balancer behaves **when things go wrong** — because that's when it really matters.
